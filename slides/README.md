# Obsidian Canvas

In order to make the presentation as understandable as possible, we have opted for the Canvas presentation of the free software **Obsidian**.
> Unfortunately, the "slides" generated by this software are not immediately exportable as PDF. We therefore took notes by hand, and took a screenshot of our Canvas.
 
You will find in this folder :
- The PDF version of our note taking. Consider it as a pdf version of our Canvas. (Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks.pdf)
- A very high resolution image of our Canvas, which we will use as a presentation aid. (Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks.png)
- A PDF of our Report, exported from **Notion**. However, we recommend that you read our report directly online here: https://henri-jamet.notion.site/Attributions-Axiomatiques-pour-les-R-seaux-Profonds-146fdf9f541b48738a7c60a2ad669ed8. (Rapport.pdf)
